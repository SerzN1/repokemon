How?
---

1. Scrape a list of all pok√©mons.
2. Use GitHub API and search for every pok√©mon name.
3. Get a matching repository name with highest number of stars.
4. üí•üí•üí•

Criteria
---

The showcase only list repositories with these criteria:

- **Repository name** matches exactly the same as Pok√©mon name.
  - ‚úÖ `name/pikachu`
  - ‚úÖ `name/mr-mime`
  - ‚úÖ `name/mr_mime`
  - ‚õîÔ∏è `name/pikachu-awesome`
  - ‚õîÔ∏è `name/pikachuuuu`
- **Most stars**. If there are few repositories with the same name, the one with most stars will be listed.
- **Contains description**, because... it has to be descriptive.
- **Contains `lang`**, the repository language determined by GitHub.

Dev
---

- `npm i` - install dependencies
- `npm run pokemon` - grab the pok√©mons
- `npm run repokemon` - grab the Github repos
  - Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`, configure it with `client_id` and `client_secret` from GitHub
  - Takes about 30 minutes to prevent API rate limit issues
- `npm run min-repokemon` - generate a *minified* version of `data/repokemon.json`, containing only the data that is rendered
- `npm run stats` - show stats of the collected data
- `npm run images` - download all pok√©mon images to `data/images` (not included in this repo)
- `npm run sprite` - generate a sprite image `data/pokemon-*.png` (not included in this repo), which I manually convert to `data/pokemon-*.jpg`
- `npm run css-min` - compress `pokemon.css` to smaller `pokemon.min.css`
- `npm run server` - start a local server at `localhost:1337`
